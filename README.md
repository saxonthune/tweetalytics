# Tweetalytics
Tweetalytics is a Python-based tool for gathering statistics on Twitter user timelines.  A simple use case is discovering which times of day coincide with high tweet volume and which users tweet the most over a given time interval.

An immediate future update will contain a script outputting results to a text file.   Future updates include data visualizations with Plotly and tools for web application use (OAuth, JSON exporting).

# Installation
First, download the prerequisite packages:
- Python (3.7.3)
